My game engine.

Very early in the making, node/component scene graph, will raise the gl version from 3.0 but am going for compatibility for now.

Tools: Contains a tool to split ttf fonts in to an image and a text file, not mine but useful and it was on my hdd so I unfortunately do not know who made it to credit it to.

Dependencies: Should contain licenses and readme files in each folder.

Everything else: Mine, except the font stuff I use.
